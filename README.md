A [Liveblog](https://www.sourcefabric.org/en/liveblog/) plugin for [Livebridge](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge).

It allows to use [Sourcefabric Liveblog](https://github.com/liveblog/liveblog) 3.0 and above as a source or target (experimental) for [Livebridge](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/livebridge).

## Installation
**Python>=3.5** is needed.
```sh
pip3 install livebridge-liveblog
```
The plugin will be automatically detected and included from **livebridge** at start time, but it has to be available in **[PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH)**

See https://pythonhosted.org/livebridge/plugins.html#installing-plugins for more infos.

## Testing
**Livebridge** uses [py.test](http://pytest.org/) and [asynctest](http://asynctest.readthedocs.io/) for testing.

Run tests:

```sh
    py.test -v tests/
```

Run tests with test coverage:

```sh
    py.test -v --cov=livebridge_liveblog --cov-report=html tests/
```

[pytest-cov](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov) has to be installed. In the example above, a html summary of the test coverage is saved in **./htmlcov/**.
